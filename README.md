ðŸŽ‚ Interactive Recipe Cost Calculator
This Python script is a simple, interactive tool that helps you calculate the total cost of a recipe based on the individual prices and quantities of its ingredients. It's especially useful for small businesses or home bakers who want to accurately price their products.

âœ¨ Features
User-Friendly Interface: The program guides you through adding each ingredient one by one.

Cost Calculation: It automatically calculates the cost of the specific amount of an ingredient you use in your recipe, even if you bought a larger package.

Input Validation: It ensures that only valid numeric input is accepted, preventing common errors.

Final Summary: After you've added all your ingredients, it provides a clear breakdown of each item's cost and the final total cost of the recipe.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Clone the Repository: First, you need to get the code. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

Bash

git clone [repository-url]
Run the Script: Navigate to the project directory and execute the script using a Python interpreter:

Bash

python recipe_calculator.py
Follow the Prompts: The program will prompt you for the following information for each ingredient:

Ingredient Name: The name of the ingredient (e.g., "farinha de trigo", "ovos").

Recipe Quantity: The amount you are using in the recipe (e.g., 200).

Unit: The unit of measurement (e.g., g, ml, un).

Package Size: The size of the package you bought from the store (e.g., 1000 for a 1 kg bag, 12 for a dozen eggs).

Package Price: The price of that specific package (e.g., 2.50).

Finish: Once you have entered all your ingredients, simply press Enter on an empty prompt to see the final cost breakdown.

ðŸ’» Code Explanation
The script is structured with two main functions:

get_numeric_input(prompt): This is a helper function that handles user input. It's designed to continuously ask the user for a number until a valid, non-negative value is entered. It also handles common user mistakes, such as using a comma (,) instead of a period (.) for decimals.

calculate_interactive_recipe_cost(): This is the main function that orchestrates the entire process. It initializes a list to store ingredients and a variable for the total cost. It then enters a while loop that continues to prompt the user for ingredient details until they choose to finish. Inside the loop, it calls the get_numeric_input helper function to collect data and then calculates the cost of the ingredient using this formula:

CostÂ perÂ ingredient= 
PackageÂ size
QuantityÂ used
â€‹
 Ã—PackageÂ price
$$$$Finally, it prints a clean and formatted summary of all ingredients and the total recipe cost.
